Spring Integration - POI (Excel) Transformer
===========================

This template includes a demonstration of Spring Integration's File support. The
template includes commonly used components such as:

* Transformer
* Wire-tap  for logging

The Transformer takes the text contents of the input file and creates an Excel Spreadsheet containing one single cell with the file's text contents.

You can run the application by either

* running the "Main" class from within STS (Right-click on Main class --> Run As --> Java Application)
* or from the command line:
    - mvn package
    - mvn exec:java
